# Some Repair Required
The game is about keeping the emoji citizens happy by fixing traffic problems.

Roads sometimes get damaged, buildings explode and throw debris on the streets, and traffic lights are manually operated.
It is your job to make sure that traffic continues to run smoothly by repairing and cleaning up the mess.
